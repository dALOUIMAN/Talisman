        "\n",
        "1.  **Deconstruct the Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Requirement 1: Length:** 2 to 63 characters total.\n",
        "    *   **Requirement 2: Allowed Characters:** Alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) *and* the hyphen (`-`).\n",
        "    *   **Requirement 3: Start and End:** Must start with an alphanumeric character *and* end with an alphanumeric character. This implicitly means the hyphen cannot be the first or last character.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Translate Requirements into Regex Components:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Length (2-63):** This is a *total length* constraint. Regex itself doesn't have a simple, direct \\\"total length\\\" quantifier applied to the *entire* match. Length is usually handled by quantifying specific parts of the pattern. We'll need to build the pattern first and then think about how to enforce the length constraint using quantifiers on the components.\n",
        "    *   **Allowed Characters (Alphanumeric + Hyphen):**\n",
        "        *   Alphanumeric: `[a-zA-Z0-9]` or `\\\\w` (though `\\\\w` often includes `_`, which is *not* allowed here, so `[a-zA-Z0-9]` is more precise). Let's use `[a-zA-Z0-9]`.\n",
        "        *   Hyphen: `-`\n",
        "        *   Combined (for the *middle* part of the string): `[a-zA-Z0-9-]`\n",
        "    *   **Start (Alphanumeric):** The pattern must begin with `[a-zA-Z0-9]`.\n",
        "    *   **End (Alphanumeric):** The pattern must end with `[a-zA-Z0-9]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Assemble the Pattern Structure:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   We need an alphanumeric character at the start: `^[a-zA-Z0-9]` (The `^` anchors the pattern to the beginning of the string).\n",
        "    *   We need an alphanumeric character at the end: `[a-zA-Z0-9]$` (The `$` anchors the pattern to the end of the string).\n",
        "    *   Between the start and end characters, we can have *zero or more* alphanumeric characters or hyphens: `[a-zA-Z0-9-]*`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   Putting these together gives a basic structure: `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$`.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Address the Length Constraint (2-63 characters):**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   The current structure `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$` inherently requires *at least* two characters (one start, one end). This satisfies the minimum length requirement of 2.\n",
        "    *   Now, how to enforce the *maximum* length of 63? The structure has three parts:\n",
        "        1.  The starting alphanumeric character (1 character).\n",
        "        2.  The middle part (`[a-zA-Z0-9-]*`) (0 or more characters).\n",
        "        3.  The ending alphanumeric character (1 character).\n",
        "    *   So, the total length is `1 + length(middle) + 1`.\n",
        "    *   The total length must be between 2 and 63.\n",
        "    *   This means `2 <= 1 + length(middle) + 1 <= 63`.\n",
        "    *   Subtracting 2 from all parts: `0 <= length(middle) <= 61`.\n",
        "    *   So, the middle part (`[a-zA-Z0-9-]*`) must have a length between 0 and 61.\n",
        "    *   We can express this using a quantifier on the middle part: `[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Refine the Pattern with the Length Constraint:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   Substitute the quantified middle part into the structure:\n",
        "        `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]$`\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **Consider Edge Cases and Alternatives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **What about a string of exactly length 2?** The pattern `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]$` works. If the middle part `[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}` matches 0 times (which is allowed by `{0,61}`), we get `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9]$`. This correctly matches a 2-character alphanumeric string. Example: \\\"a1\\\".\n",
        "    *   **What about a string of length 3?** Example: \\\"a-b\\\". Start: `a`, Middle: `-` (length 1, within {0,61}), End: `b`. Matches. Example: \\\"abc\\\". Start: `a`, Middle: `b` (length 1, within {0,61}), End: `c`. Matches.\n",
        "    *   **What about a string of length 63?** Start: `a`, Middle: 61 allowed characters, End: `b`. Total length 1 + 61 + 1 = 63. Matches.\n",
        "    *   **Alternative using Lookaheads?** One *could* try using lookaheads to enforce the length, but it's generally less efficient and harder to read for this specific scenario. A common (but less suitable here) pattern would be `^(?=.{2,63}$)[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]$`. The `(?=.{2,63}$)` is a positive lookahead asserting that the *entire* string from the current position (`^`) to the end (`$`) has between 2 and 63 characters (`.`). While technically correct, the first pattern (`^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]$`) is more direct and arguably easier to understand because the length constraint is directly embedded in the consuming part of the pattern. The first approach is preferable for this case.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **Final Regex Selection:** `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9]$`\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **Prepare the Explanation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   Explain each component: `^`, `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, `[a-zA-Z0-9-]`, `{0,61}`, `$`.\n",
        "    *   Explain how the components combine to meet each requirement.\n",
        "    *   Specifically clarify how the start/end requirement and the length requirement interact (start + middle + end = total length).\n",

        "\n",
        "9.  **Write the Python Code:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   Import the `re` module.\n",
        "    *   Define the regex string.\n",
        "    *   Create a list of test strings (covering matching, non-matching, edge cases).\n",
        "    *   Loop through the test strings.\n",
        "    *   Use `re.fullmatch()` because the regex uses `^` and `$` anchors, meaning the *entire* string must match the pattern. Using `re.search()` would find substrings, which isn't the desired behavior here.\n",
        "    *   Print the results clearly for each test string.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Review and Refine:** Read through the regex, explanation, and code. Ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Check that the examples align with the regex logic. Make sure the explanation directly addresses how each user requirement was met. Ensure the Python code uses the correct `re` function (`fullmatch`).\"\"\"),\n",

        "        *   `A-Z`: any uppercase letter\n",
        "        *   `0-9`: any digit\n",
        "    *   **Requirement Met:** This directly fulfills the requirement that the string *must start* with an alphanumeric character.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}`**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Defines the characters allowed in the *middle* of the string and their quantity.\n",
        "    *   **Meaning:**\n",
        "        *   `[a-zA-Z0-9-]`: This character class matches exactly one character that is alphanumeric (`a-zA-Z0-9`) *or* a hyphen (`-`).\n",
        "        *   `{0,61}`: This is a quantifier that applies to the preceding character class `[a-zA-Z0-9-]`. It means \\\"match the previous element (the allowed character class) between 0 and 61 times, inclusive\\\".\n",
        "    *   **Requirements Met:**\n",
        "        *   This allows the use of alphanumeric characters and hyphens within the string (Requirement 2).\n",
        "        *   Crucially, it combines with the start and end characters (explained next) to control the overall length. Since the string *must* have one alphanumeric character at the start and one at the end (total 2), the middle part can have a length ranging from 0 (for a total string length of 2) up to 61 (for a total string length of 1 + 61 + 1 = 63). This ensures the total length constraint of 2-63 characters (Requirement 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **`[a-zA-Z0-9]`**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** Defines the character allowed at the *end* of the string.\n",

        "    *   **Requirement Met:** This directly fulfills the requirement that the string *must end* with an alphanumeric character.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **`$`**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** This is the \\\"end of string\\\" anchor.\n",
        "    *   **Meaning:** It asserts that the pattern preceding it must occur at the very end of the string being tested. Combined with `^`, it ensures the *entire* string matches the pattern from start to finish.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In summary:** The regex demands a string that:\n",
        "*   Starts (`^`) with one alphanumeric character (`[a-zA-Z0-9]`).\n",
        "*   Is followed by 0 to 61 characters, each being either alphanumeric or a hyphen (`[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}`).\n",
